# Scrit Assignment 0

I have finished the intro steps and watched the Git & Github Grash Course video. The following is what I have learned and what I am still confused about.

 - I learned the basics terms and and how to use them such as how to commit, push, fork, clone, and how to create a pull request. 
 - This is new to me so I am still confused on how to use GitHub to its full potential.

I am a hands on learner, so the more I use GitHub, the more I will feel comfortable with it.
